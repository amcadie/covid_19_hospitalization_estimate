### Exploratory Analysis of Covid-19 Public Datasets

All the great public datasets that have been published over the last month provides a great opportunity to look at to answer some of my own questions, and investigate the spread of the disease with different lenses than what may be out in the news.  It's also a good chance to brush up on Pandas and Altair (I'm mostly all dplyr and ggplot2 at work).

For a better viewing experience, with fully rendered Altair plots, look at the notebook on [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/amcadie/covid_19_hospitalization_estimate/blob/master/covid19_hospitalizations.ipynb)
